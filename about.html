        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I make beats literally all day. It's all that I do. Entrust me with your music and it will sound dope. If I’m willing to have no social life because of music, why wouldn’t you trust me?. Growing up going to Columbia High School in Maplewood, NJ, I was shown the beauty of hip hop culture. Listening to GOATs like Uzi, Pi’erre Bourne, Lucki, Future, Carti and of course, Fetty Wap all the way since 2015 have trained my ear to be able to curate the ultimate trap symphony, comprised of the highest grade samples and one shots available. Whether you’ll need an overdrive infused Playboi Carti rage beat, or a soft, slow BPM piano trap ballad, my hard drive can provide. Versatility is a big part of why I am signed to Vegan Steak Records, an LA based label who signs producers and provides them with production opportunities. </p>
